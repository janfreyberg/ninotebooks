This tool is also helpful for inspecting the surface reconstruction has worked properly (instead of step 4 above). If the red surface doesn’t cover the whole cortex but parts of the cortex are outside of it, then you will have to fix the reconstruction. This may be due to too sharply defined structural images.

You will need to copy and paste two of these into a text file called `Coregistration.txt` inside your `freesurfer/subjects/SUBJECT/surf` folder. The two matrices are the one entitled `Tmov` (2nd from top) and `RegMat` (5th). _(Note that copy&paste is annoying in the Linux terminal in that it only works via right-clicking and using the context menu – keyboard combos don’t work)_. You will need to place the `RegMat` matrix underneath the `Tmov` matrix so that in the file there will be a matrix with 8 rows and 4 columns. Finally, you must remove the semicolons at the end of the lines.\n",
